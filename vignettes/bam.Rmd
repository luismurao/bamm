The `bamm` package is an R package designed to create and operate on large 
(tens of millions of cells) matrices regarding to each element of the 
$\textbf{BAM}$ scheme, for example, the adjacency matrix (connectivity matrix), 
and the niche suitability matrices. 

The following vignette presents the basic functions and methods of the `bamm` 
package. The package has three main functionalities related to each element of
the **BAM** scheme.

```{r setup}
library(bamm)
```

## **A** functions

### Convert niche models to sparse matrices 

The package uses sparse matrices to represent those objects which allows it to 
optimize computers memory and make important speed ups in computation times by 
eliminating operations on zero elements. The basic function of 
the package is `model2sparse` which converts a raster model to an **setA** class

```{r}
model_path <- system.file("extdata/Lepus_californicus_cont.tif",
                          package = "bamm")
model <- raster::raster(model_path) 
# binary model
model_bin <- model > 0.7
sparse_mod <- bamm::model2sparse(model = model_bin)

```

The slots of the object are 

```{r}
sparse_mod
```



## M functions

### Connectivity matrix 

The function to estimate connectivity between pixels of a given raster is `adj_mat`,
(generally is the M area but can be any matrix); 
it uses  sparse adjacency matrices.  


```{r}
 # Adjacency matrix from a niche model


adj_mod <- adj_mat(sparse_mod,ngbs=1,eigen_sys = T)
adj_mod
```

The map of the connectivity matrix `adj_mod` is


```{r fig.cap="Fig. 1 Connectivity map of `adj_mod` object. Here green color means more connected."}
model_eig <- model
model_eig[sparse_mod@cellIDs] <- abs(adj_mod@eigen_vec)
raster::plot(model_eig)
```


## AM objects 

These are objects that combine **SetA** and **SetM** .

### Connectivity Suitability diagram

Estimates the connectivity suitability and dispersal diagram. It shows the 
number of geographic clusters as a function of dispersal and suitability. 


```{r}
clustersin <- bamm::bam_clusters(model=sparse_mod,
                                ngbs=1,plot_model=FALSE)
```
The function returns the following slots

```{r}
clustersin
```
Lets see the geographic clusters as function of suitability and dispersal

```{r fig.cap="Figure 2. An interative map showing the geographic clusters for a species that can travel two steps per unit time"}
clustersin@interactive_map
```

```{r fig.cap="Figure 3. An raster map showing the geographic clusters for a species that can travel two steps per unit time"}
raster::plot(clustersin@raster_map)
```


### The CSD diagram

The CSD diagram is a simple but useful tool to estimate the number of dispersal
steps that a species needs to travel per unit time in order to occupy its potential
area of distribution. In this example the approximate number of dispersal steps to
archive all suitable patches is 30 (not shown here).

```{r fig.width=4,fig.height=4,fig.cap="Figure 4. Connectivity Sutitability Dispersal plot (CSD plot).\nThe mean number of connected cells (MNCC) is showed in the legend."}
csd_plot <- bamm::csd_estimate(sparse_mod,
                              dispersal_steps=c(2,4,8))
plot(csd_plot$csd$`dispersal_step:_4`@raster_map,
     main="CSD clusters")

```

abstract = {A well-known problem in numerical ecology is how to recombine presence-absence matrices without altering row and column totals. A few solutions have been proposed, but all of them present some issues in terms of statistical robustness (that is, their capability to generate different matrix configurations with the same probability) and their performance (that is, the computational effort that they require to generate a null matrix). Here we introduce the 'Curveball algorithm', a new procedure that differs from existing methods in that it focuses rather on matrix information content than on matrix structure. We demonstrate that the algorithm can sample uniformly the set of all possible matrix configurations requiring a computational effort orders of magnitude lower than that required by available methods, making it possible to easily randomize matrices larger than 108 cells. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

  title={Visualizing species richness and site similarity from presence-absence matrices},

  DOI={10.17161/bi.v16i1.14782},
  abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Species richness and similarity of biotas among distinct sites are important quantities in biogeography. Indices derived from presence-absence matrices are used to represent these quantities in so-called diversity-range plots. &amp;amp;nbsp;The most commonly used diversity-range plot, however, has multiple special cases and its interpretation is cumbersome. Here we present an equivalent formulation that is geometrically simpler and has no special cases. In addition, we introduce a method to identify the statistical significance of the dispersion field, an index that represents how similar species composition is in a cell with respect to the whole area. The new diversity-range plot is a promising tool to explore biodiversity and endemism in a region as the values shown in this plot and whether they are statistically significant or not can also be represented in geography.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
